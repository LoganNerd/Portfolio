In this challenge we were given the task of creating a professional portfolio to share with prospective employers! Before I started I created a rough
wire frame of what I wanted my portfolio to look like. Since I wanted the sections to be obvious, I changed my flexboxes a little to properly show functioning
nav bar links.
