# Portfolio
Logan Juul's professional portfolio!

In this challenge we were given the task of creating a professional portfolio to share with prospective employers! Before I started I created a rough
wire frame of what I wanted my portfolio to look like. Since I wanted the sections to be obvious, I changed my flexboxes a little to properly show functioning
nav bar links. 

Since I have no work to present at this time I added links to youtube videos I have created over the years! I love video editing and composition so I figuered I'd show off those skills as well! The shipwreck dive video was my senior project where I recorded my journey from getting scuba certified and then flying to Key West, FL to dive on a shipwreck! The other 2 videos are of my most prized possession, my car.
